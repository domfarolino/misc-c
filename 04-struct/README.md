# struct

These are some basic examples of using structs in C. Most of these are old
code snippets I've decided to publish so I can centralize my code examples
while getting rid of random untracked things on my laptop.

The first example demonstrates using a struct with a function pointer member
and briefly talks about how we can use functions easier in C++.

The second example demonstrates using `typedef` with structs in C and how to
make that more manageable. A lot of it comes from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17720223)
lovely stackoverflow post.
