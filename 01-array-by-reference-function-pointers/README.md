# 01-array-by-reference-function-pointers

The code in this folder demonstrates passing statically allocated arrays
by reference in C++, using function pointers, and arrays of function pointers.
Function pointers are often used in C++ code that directly deals with UI, as UI
stuff often uses functions as callbacks.
